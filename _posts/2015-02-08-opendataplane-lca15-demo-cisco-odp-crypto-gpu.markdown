Cisco will demonstrate Crypto with GPUÂ at Linaro Connect Asia 2015 in Hong Kong.

### Objective

Demonstrate the versatility of the ODP APIs in a heterogeneous computing environment by implementing cryptographic functions on a GPU and accessing them via the ODP Crypto APIs.

### Description

The ODP Crypto APIs have been implemented utilizing OpenCL environment to perform 3DES functionality on a GPU.
This allows the ODP IPsec example application (enhanced to support IPinIP tunnels) to perform ESP encryption/decryption much faster than a pure SW approach running natively on the x86 CPU.
