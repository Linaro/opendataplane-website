The performance of Linux-based network solutions was one of the biggest issues in the past and that's why Intel started the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) project. The goal of the ODP environment is to provide a cross ­platform framework for data plane applications. ODP is an open source project which provides the environment for data plane applications. It is easy to use, provides high ­performance and is also portable across various networking system on chip (SoCs) and instruction sets and architectures such as ARM and Intel. The OPD environment consists of configuration files, services, APIs for different architectures and utilities which are optimized for the different underlying hardware vendors. The purpose of the ODP environment is to separate the API from the underlying architectures and it is designed in a way to support both software and hardware implementations to deeply exploit acceleration features present in modern SoCs.


**Open Fast Path (OFP)**

As we know, high-performance devices are required for the exponentially growing data traffic which demands a fast packet processing devices or machines in the network. OpenFastPath is another open source implementation of a high-performance TCP/IP stack which is helpful for network applications with a traditional Linux stack. The main functionality of OFP is provided as a library for different applications which are using ODP for the completion, execution model and framework. OFP supports both DPDK and ODP for high performance of network solutions.
