# Abstract of the Webinar

OpenDataPlane (ODP) is a fundamental open source, cross-architecture and cross-platform data plane programming  API which enables application portability across diverse platforms from the edge through to the core of the network. It has been conceived and developed over 2 years by a cross section of networking stakeholders including OEMs, SoC vendors and ISVs to meet the unyielding latency, power and size constraints of real network deployments which demand diverse and scalable compute platforms based on highly-integrated, **_workload-optimized_** SoCs, supported by a common layer of enabling software.

This webinar will outline how ODP abstracts implementation details from developers;  enabling access to diverse hardware and software functions with a common API. Until now, OEMs and ISVs developers had to target proprietary, vendor-optimized APIs for each vendors’ platform, making it difficult to take full advantage of unique features without creating migration barriers, defeating choice and flexibility. Attendees will come to understand  how ODP uniquely embraces and extends vendor-optimized run-time environments offered today by all silicon vendors, and enables the utilization of any available, underlying hardware acceleration capabilities, decoupling software innovation from hardware resources while still maximizing throughput efficiency. A review of collaborative specification and development efforts with the NFV community will demonstrate the tremendous value ODP brings to the realization of NFV goals, while leveraging the innovation of the full range of networking silicon platforms available in the market today.

# Speaker Biographies

[Bob Monkman](http://community.arm.com/people/bobmonkman) is part of the Enterprise Segment Marketing Team at ARM, located in San Jose, CA and focused on Enterprise Networking and Software Initiatives for the Enterprise Segment such as Linaro Networking Group, where Bob sits on the Steering Committee, the ETSI NFV ISG and the OPNFV initiative. Bob has been in embedded computing for 25+ years, much of it in the commercial RTOS/Middleware world focused on the network communications infrastructure space and did a stint in High Performance Clustered Computing. Bob's career roles have spanned largely Product Management/Marketing, Strategic Alliances, and Business Development, but he started his career as a hardware/software engineer for Tellabs. Bob’s technology experience includes embedded operating systems, incl. Linux, NFV/SDN, M2M/IoT, Systems Management Middleware strategy and development tools- now delving deeper into silicon designs. Bob was the Carrier-Grade Linux PM at MontaVista from 2003-2005, where he was active in the Service Availability Forum and Carrier Grade Linux Working Group. Bob holds a BSEE from the University of Illinois.



Bill Fischofer Senior Software Engineer, Linaro Networking Group

Bill has over 25 years’ experience in the information technology sector, working on everything from IBM mainframe systems to ASICs. He joined the Linaro Networking Group in September 2013 after having worked for the previous decade at several public and private companies in network architecture and data plane firmware development. He is currently the LNG technical lead for the OpenDataPlane project.
