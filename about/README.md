## About

> OpenDataPlane (ODP) is a cross-platform data plane SoC networking open source API.

#### **What is the OpenDataPlane project?**

The OpenDataPlane project has been established to produce an open-source, cross-platform set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for the networking data plane.

#### **Our Focus**

ODP embraces and extends existing proprietary, optimized vendor-specific hardware blocks and software libraries to provide interoperability with minimal overhead. Initially defined by members of the Linaro Networking Group (LNG), this project is open to contributions from all individuals and companies who share an interest in promoting a standard set of APIs to be used across the full range of network processor architectures available.

#### **We welcome you to join us!**

If you or your company are interested in participating in this effort, please see the links on the left. It is our supporting members that drive the definition of new APIs. However, once published anyone may contribute to the API’s and continued refinement. ODP welcomes all feedback and participation in the development of ODP including addition of new platforms.

#### **Organization & Governance**

The ODP project is managed in a transparent manner. Our weekly meetings are open to the public. Contributors and interested parties are welcome to join us. ODP roadmap plans are discussed at each Linaro Connect [event](http://connect.linaro.org/) (held twice per year). Linaro and its members also host live engineering sprints on an as needed basis, covering specialized topics where intense collaboration benefits the project.

ODP is currently supported by over a dozen network hardware and software industry companies. The supporting organizations are generally members of the Linaro Network Group (LNG). Members of LNG also have voting positions on the LNG Steering Committee (LNG-SC). The LNG-SC maintains privileges for overall direction and governance over the ODP project and product road map.

#### Get Involved

Please join us on Tuesday’s regular public meeting at 15:00 UTC at [meetings.opendataplane.org](http://meetings.opendataplane.org/). View the [ODP Meeting Minutes](https://collaborate.linaro.org/display/ODP/OpenDataPlane).
