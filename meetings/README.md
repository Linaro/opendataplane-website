Public OpenDataPlane (ODP) discussions currently occur every Tuesday at 15:00 UTC (8:00 a.m. PDT). If you would like to join the regular meeting, it occurs every Tuesday at 15:00 UTC at [meetings.opendataplane.org](http://meetings.opendataplane.org).

In addition to conference calls, all people interested in ODP are invited to attend [Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org "Linaro Connect"). This is the best opportunity to meet people face to face, see demos and participate in ODP-related discussions and hacking. Linaro also organizes engineering hacking sessions every year for ODP usually hosted by one of our gracious members in Silicon Valley.
