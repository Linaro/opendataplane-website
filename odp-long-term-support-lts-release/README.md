# ODP Long Term Support (LTS) Release

ODP is supported by many vendors who provide implementations of the ODP API, to ensure a stable platform for application developers long term supoort releases are designated. These releases pass the ODP validation suite on all conforming implementations allowing simple portability between platforms.

Linaro maintains the ODP API specification and as part of the same repository the testsuite and reference odp-linux implimentation, it is this reference that all implementations comply to.
