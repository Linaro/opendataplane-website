### Bug Trackers

ODP consists of an API specification and a set of reference implementations that realize these APIs on different platforms. Implementations range from pure software to those that deeply exploit the various hardware acceleration and offload features found on modern networking SoCs.

The bug trackers reflect those issues found in the SW contained in the ODP git repos, although for specific implementations, SoC vendors may be responsible for acting on the issues raised that are unique to their SoC.

For all NEW defects, please submit the issues to the ODP product (or sub-component) on the [Bugzilla](https://bugs.linaro.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=OpenDataPlane "Linaro Bugzilla") defect tracking system.
